1. 	for acos code, we can use below compile flag for common code
	in file ~/userspace/project/acos/config.in
		ifeq ($(FXCN_CMS_SUPPORT),1)
		CFLAGS += -DFXCN_CMS_SUPPORT
		endif #FXCN_CMS_SUPPORT
	or you can find below export in ~/Makefile
		FXCN_CMS_SUPPORT := 1
2. 	For BRCM code with fxcn patch, please modify 2 things
	a. 	modify Makefile
			ifeq ($(FXCN_FW_FEATURES),1)
			CFLAG += -DACOS_MODULES_ENABLE
			endif
		or you can refer the changes in below libnvram.so's Makefile
			~/userspace/private/apps/wlan/unfnvram/Makefile
	b. 	Make sure the modification been separate with define ACOS_MODULES_ENABLE
			#if defined(ACOS_MODULES_ENABLE)
			.....
			#endif /*ACOS_MODULES_ENABLE*/
			
3. 	Profile MR60/MS60 for easymesh.
	Profile RAX20 for RAX20.

There are two documents that discuss this issue:
1.docs/HOWTO/LinuxDeveloperGuide.pdf
2.Configuration Management System Porting and Development Guide in DocSafe (963XX-PG204-R)
This is also mirrored in docs/internalDocs/cms-dev-guide.pdf

Issues to consider:
-Where to put the app, depends on license of the code. See (2) Section 16
-Use .autodetect mechanism. See (1) Section 6.5 and (2) Section 17
-Support conditional building, selectable from make menuconfig. See (1) Section 6.1
-Make other subsystems/libraries/apps aware of this app or feature. See (1) Section 6.2
-Try to use a standard Makefile template. See (1) Section 6.6 and (2) Section 17.
-Advantage of using the standard Makefile template is you can type make from the local directory (no need to type make from the top)
-Does my app need a CMS Entity ID (EID)?
-Understand the difference between an App and Command. See (2) Section 17.
-App and Commands need to have an EID if:
-It will use CMS Logging service
-It will use CMS Message service
-It will access the MDM
